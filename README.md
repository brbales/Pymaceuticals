Pymaceuticals

Mock drug trial analysis using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Mice were treated with multiple test drugs over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were monitored over that time. Analyze the data to show how four drugs (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) perform.

Tasks:

Create scatter plots for tumor volume changes over time for each treatment, metastatic site changes over time, and mouse survival over treatment.
Include error bars on each scatter plots.
Create a bar graph comparing total percent tumor volume change for each treatment over the 45 days.
Write a brief description of three observable trends based on the data.
